### Objective

Your assignment is to implement a movie streaming dashboard using **TypeScript** and **React**. 

You are expected to spend at most 3 hours.

### Brief

You are the owner of a movie theater in **Crypto City**. Your customers are bored with the never changing selection and are asking for something completely different - they want to see what's playing on **Sav State**. You quickly scribble down some notes and after a few hours of relentless work you have a design in mind.

### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **TypeScript**
    -   Framework: **React**
-   Build out the project to the mockups inside the [*mockups*](./mockups) folder
-   Connect your application to the **Sav State Movies API** at `https://sav.state/movies`
-   For authentication pass the `"Authorization: Bearer savstate2021"` header
-   Make sure that linking to detail pages as well as bookmarking works as expected
-   Implement search by connecting to `https://sav.state/movies?q=<search_term>`

The URL `https://sav.state/movies` is obviously made up. However the JSON payload is in [*movies.json*](./movies.json). 
### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code and documentation in a GitHub repository and let us know the URL.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   Use **React** and follow **TypeScript** best practices;
-   Completeness: have you completed all the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is the code written (and project structured) in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?
-   (Bonus point) See if you could come up with a good integration test setup to emulate real API calls.

We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program.

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were
going into production - then push your changes to the main branch of the GitHub repository of your choosing.

Good luck and happy coding,
