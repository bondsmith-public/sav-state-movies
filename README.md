### Objective

Your assignment is to implement a movie streaming dashboard using **TypeScript** and **React**. 

You are expected to spend at most 3 hours.

### Brief

You are the owner of a movie theater in **Crypto City**. Your customers are bored with the never changing selection of movies and are 
 asking for something completely different. So you've decided to open a dedicated area for watching TV shows on the big screen at **Sav State**. 
 However, you need a way of surfacing available TV shows to customers. 

You quickly scribble down some notes and after a few hours of relentless work you have a design in mind.

### Tasks

-   Implement assignment using:
    -   Language: **TypeScript**
    -   Framework: **React**
-   Build out the project to the mockups inside the [*mockups*](./mockups) folder
-   Connect your application to the **TVMaze API** (Documentation: [https://www.tvmaze.com/api](https://www.tvmaze.com/api))
-   Make sure that when interacting with the search functionality:
    -   The search query is persisted in the URL, if you reload the page it will search with the same query
    -   Navigating to a show updates the URL, if you reload the page it will load the same movie
-   Implement search by using the show search endpoint
-   On initial load when there is nothing to query, use the schedule (not the web/streaming schedule endpoint) endpoint to display 
        a list of shows with episodes premiering today, scope it to the uk and use current date. 

### Deliverables

Make sure to include all source code and documentation in a GitHub repository and let us know the URL.

### Evaluation Criteria

-   Use **React** and follow **TypeScript** best practices;
-   Completeness: have you completed all the features?
-   Correctness: does the functionality act in sensible, thought-out ways?
-   Maintainability: is the code written (and project structured) in a clean, maintainable way?
-   Testing: is the system adequately tested?
-   (Bonus point) See if you could come up with a good integration test setup to emulate real API calls.

We're looking for you to produce working code, with enough room to demonstrate how to structure components in a small program.

Please organize, design, test and document your code as if it were going into production - then push your changes to the main 
 branch of the GitHub repository of your choosing.

Good luck and happy coding,
